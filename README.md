# Nginx Upstream Monitor

This Docker container reads upstream information from an nginx-plus server using the API and posts a status message about it to a chat room. Currently it only displays information messages on the console but more integrations will be added soon.

## Example usage

This example queries the nginx demo site, https://demo.nginx.com/

```
docker run -e NGINX_SERVER_URL=https://demo.nginx.com/ --rm -t kindredgroup/nginx-upstream-monitor
```

## Upcoming integrations

  - HipChat on-premise
  - Microsoft Teams
  - Slack
